	<h2 class="L2">Family (Biological)</h2>
	<p>The godfather was born <bold>Vito Andolini</bold> on December 7, 1892 in the town of Corleone in Sicily. He migrated to NYC in 1902 via Ellis Island and due to a clerical error, was renamed Vito Corleone. He raised his family in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, where I was also born and raised.</p>

	<p>Vito knew nothing of a life of crime, and lived a decent, hardworking life working for his friend, Genco Abandando&apos;s father, who owned a local grocery store. Vito was laid off from this job when a local Mafia Chieftan, Don Fanucci, who forced local store owners to pay tributes from their daily profits made the owner hire his nephew.</p>  

	<p>Having to feed his young family, consisting of only Fredo and Sonny at the time, he met a young man from the neighborhood named Peter Clemenza who quickly introduced Vito to a life of crime. He quickly established himself as the leader of his crime crew after assassinating Don Fanucci during a relifious festival because the mafia chief was cutting into his turf and profits, and young Vito saw his murder as both a way to take over the neighborhood while also ridding himself of his main rival, thereby earning him respect and the title of Don.</p> 

	<p>Frequently throughout the Godfather, religion is sprinkled in when they are committing murder, somehow justifying Corleone Family hits with montages of God and religious overtones.</p>

	<h2 class="L2">Family (Crime)</h2>
	<p>Vito&apos;s friend, Genco Abandando, would go on to become the Family&apos;s Consiglierie, or advisor to the Don, while Peter Clemenza and their other crime partner, Salvatore Tessio, would become the Family&apos;s Caporegimes, or Captains, both in charge of their own crime crews.</p>

	<p>Upon Don Vito&apos;s death of a heart attack, his youngest son Michael, a war hero and very much against his father&apos;s role in a life of crime at first, before turning his loyalty back to the "Family" after an  assassination attempt on his father&apos;s life in the French Hospital in Chelsea, completely shook up the crime family.</p>
